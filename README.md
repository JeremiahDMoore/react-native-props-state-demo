# React Native Props and State Demo

A simple React Native application demonstrating various methods to update state and props, including the use of reducers with the `useReducer` hook.

## Features

- **State Management**: Demonstrates updating state using `useState` and `useReducer`.
- **Props Handling**: Shows how to pass and update props between components.
- **Reducer Usage**: Implements reducers for complex state management scenarios.

## Technologies Used

- **React Native**: Framework for building native apps using React.
- **JavaScript**: Programming language for logic implementation.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JeremiahDMoore/react-native-props-state-demo.git
   cd react-native-props-state-demo
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
